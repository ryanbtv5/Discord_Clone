### ðŸ§  Replit Agent Prompt: Discord Clone App

> **Prompt to enter in the Agent tool's text area when creating a new app:**

---

**"Create a full-stack Discord clone app with the following features:**

1. **Authentication**:

   * Use Firebase Authentication (email/password and Google sign-in).
   * Show login and registration screens with form validation.

2. **Server (Guild) System**:

   * Users can create and join servers with names and images.
   * Display a list of joined servers in a sidebar.

3. **Channel System**:

   * Each server has multiple text channels.
   * Users can view and switch between channels.

4. **Chat Functionality**:

   * Real-time chat using Firebase Firestore (channel messages stored in subcollections).
   * Support text and optional image messages (stored via Firebase Storage).

5. **UI/UX**:

   * Style similar to Discord with a sidebar for servers, a middle pane for channels, and a main pane for messages.
   * Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile.

6. **Technology Stack**:

   * Use React + Firebase or Next.js + Firebase for the frontend.
   * Use Firebase Firestore, Auth, and Storage for the backend.
   * Use Tailwind CSS or Material UI for styling.

7. **Additional Features (optional)**:

   * Typing indicators
   * Emojis support
   * Ability to delete own messages
   * Dark mode toggle

Please set up a Firebase config file and help me connect it securely to the app using `.env` for keys. Include clear folder structure (components, pages, styles, services) and Firestore rules suggestions. I want to be able to add more features later using Agent."\*\*

* Generate a working MVP with chat, servers, and channels
